# Abstract
o Conventional cyber defense tools (intrusion detection systems and anti-virus) focus on at-risk components, traditional intrusion methodologies and observed system        vulnerabilities.

o Advanced Persistent Threat or APT is a new type of threat that is defined by an adversary that is more trained, better equipped and more informed about conventional      cyber defense methods. The APT threat renders conventional methods insufficient to counter the attacks launched by this adversary.

o This new type of adversary conducts multi-year attacks targeting economic, private or national security information.

o Cyber defense techniques have put in place a feedback loop, which will allow the collection of information about the attacks. This will allow defenders to improve        their knowledge of the opponent. This method allows to reduce the chances of success of the opponent at each attack.

o Based on the collected information, the creation of the attack pattern named kil Chain was possible. The Kill Chain model is a model that allows to synthesize the        different phases of an intrusion, in order to prepare and anticipate the next move of the adversary and thus reduce its chances of success.

o The accelerated evolution of threats, requires an investment in network defense and especially a defense model based on intelligence as highlighted by the use of the       Kill Chain.
